## Verbs

### Auxillary Verbs
There are two auxilary verbs:
- essere (to be) 
- avere (to have)

### Regular 
This are the three primary regular conjugations, **-are**, **-ere** and **-ire** and can be conjugated with **essere** and **avere** depending on the verb:

| type | essere                        | avere                            | reflexive  |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| -are | sembrare (to seem / appear)   | lavare (to wash)                 | lavarsi    |
| -ere | decedere (to die / pass away) | credere (to believe / think)     | credersi   | 
| -ire | partire (to leave / initiate) | divertire (to entertain / amuse) | divertirsi |

The **avere** verbs were chosen due to being **reflexive** as well, handy for contrasting usage.

### Irregular (WIP / TBC)
There are at least 115 other irregular patterns across -are, -ere and -ire, so some common verbs are listed here.    

#### Functional
- stare (to stay / be in a state of)
- fare (to do)
