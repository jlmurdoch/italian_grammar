# Italian Grammar in LaTeX format

This is a work-in-progress repo for examples of italian grammar written in LaTeX markup language.

These were compiled using the LaTeX Workshop extension in Microsoft Visual Studio Code, with the output in GhostScript-optimised PDF.

## Verbs

### Auxillary Verbs
There are two auxilary verbs:
- [essere](./pdf/essere.pdf) (to be) 
- [avere](./pdf/avere.pdf) (to have)

### Regular 
This are the three primary regular conjugations, **-are**, **-ere** and **-ire** and can be conjugated with **essere** and **avere** depending on the verb:

| type | essere                        | avere                            | reflexive  |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| -are | [sembrare](./pdf/sembrare.pdf) (to seem / appear) | [lavare](./pdf/lavare.pdf) (to wash) | [lavarsi](./pdf/lavarsi.pdf) |
| -ere | [decedere](./pdf/decedere.pdf) (to die / pass away) | [credere](./pdf/credere.pdf) (to believe / think) | [credersi](./pdf/credersi.pdf)  | 
| -ire | [partire](./pdf/partire.pdf) (to leave / initiate) | [divertire](./pdf/divertire.pdf) (to entertain / amuse) | [divertirsi](./pdf/divertirsi.pdf) |

The **avere** verbs were chosen due to being **reflexive** as well, handy for contrasting usage.

### Irregular (WIP / TBC)
There are at least 115 other irregular patterns across -are, -ere and -ire, so some common verbs are listed here.    

#### Selected examples
- [stare](./pdf/stare.pdf) (to stay / be in a state of)
- [fare](./pdf/fare.pdf) (to do)
